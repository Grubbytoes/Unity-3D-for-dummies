I have made a grave mistake. I believed there was a way the specimen could be woken from the slumber of time, but in my folly I have created a waking nightmare. It is locked away with the rest of the dark, forgotten, and foolish things. I pray it stays there.

I must pause my studies—I have become hasty and arrogant and forgotten my place in the world—if I ever truly knew it. It is not my lot to challenge nature. I will meditate on my transgression.
