Humanity thinks we are the kings of this world. Maybe. 

But kings fallâ€”they are overthrown and forgotten; their names pass into myth and song, which themselves last only as long as there is anyone to sing them. Few outlive their kingdom, and no kingdom outlives the Earth upon which it is built. Earth, Gaia, she makes a mockery of kings.

Perhaps I have gazed too long into the hollow eyes of forgotten monsters. Did they not, too, consider themselves the masters of their world? Did they think themselves the sole inheritors and scholars of all around them? Now we dig up their fossilized bodies and make of them exhibits and trinkets and call ourselves the scholars.

I am weary and have been made humble. I have listened to the Mouth of Gaia and am at peace with her words. Before her, all your gods are forgotten, and all your monsters are slain.
