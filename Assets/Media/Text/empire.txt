The Amber Imperial College... I would not wish to speak ill of my colleagues were my colleagues not fools. I fear the Empire's hunger for power has infected too many of them. Every new discovery, every new angle of thought, is viewed only as a vessel for political gain.

What became of the love for knowledge? Understanding for understanding's sake—is that not the mandate of a scientist? There are days when I truly believe I am the last one who believes that—perhaps that is why I question my sanity...

Imbeciles, all of them...
