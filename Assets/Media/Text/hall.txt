Such a glorious specimine. Megalosaurus Bucklandii, scarcely a bone or tooth missing, and all that is there set in it's perfect place. As I found it, so lifelike was its articulation that I fancied were I to put my ear against its petrified form, I would hear the beating of its ancient and terrible heart.

It has been bought here, to Rexhill Hall; a dusty and forlorn place I inherited from some distant, widowed relative and scarcely knew or cared what use I might make of it. The College does not know what I have found. They cannot know - not yet.
